# Community Helper

This is a prototype for a React app that manages services offered and supports user registration. It simulates the user experience of creating an account, logging in, registering for services, and making donations.

The hosted site can be found at [https://agiamona.github.io/community-helper](https://agiamona.github.io/community-helper)
